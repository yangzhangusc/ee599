#Brief decription: This program read two metrix A,B from input.txt and do the native matrix multiply and Strassan method of matrix multiply separately.As for Strassan method, I use recursive function to realize.

1.For create dynamic 2d array:
The line 5-23 of code in the website https://blog.csdn.net/KYJL888/article/details/77846122, which indirectly inspired me to use int **=new int*[] to create array in my code line 138-158.


2.For find nest power of 2:
The line 1-20 in method 3 in the website https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/smallest-power-of-2-greater-than-or-equal-to-n/ directly taught me how to find next power of 2 in my code line 370-384.

3.For Strassan Method
The code in https://blog.csdn.net/s634772208/article/details/46594707 show me the template, but I coded my own in some different way in the line 174-366.
